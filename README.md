HomeAutomation
==============

Senior Design Project

This project is for our EE 495/CME 495 Senior Engineering Design project.
We aim to create a system that can locate a users indoor position, thereby improving on GPS accuracy.
We wish to then use the location data to automate the users home lighting.  Which can also be extended to
distrubuted audio and video systems.
